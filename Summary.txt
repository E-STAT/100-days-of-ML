===================================== DAY 01=============================
I completed one of the mision have been doing on Dataquest.
In this mission, I learned how to:

...Remove unwanted characters to "clean" data stored as strings.
...Make data more uniform by replacing characters and modifying the case.
...Handle errors during data cleaning.
...Parse and clean complex strings.
...In the next mission, we're going to continue working with the MoMA data set as we learn the basics of analyzing data in Python.

====================================DAY 02=======================================
Today I completed another mission on Dataquest.
Things I learnt:

...Create logic to analyze artist age data.
...Create frequency table dictionaries.
...Easily insert values into strings to summarize the results of our analysis.
...Format numbers inside of strings to make things easier to understand.
In the next mission, we'll learn about one of the most important core principles for working in Python: object-oriented programming (I will put in my best this time to sink the concept of OOP).

================================= DAY 03========================================
I was able to learn the following today:

...What objects, classes, methods, and attributes are.
...How to create a class and instantiate a new object.
...How to store attributes inside objects using the init method.
...How to create methods to transform data and update attributes.

================================= DAY 04 ================================
Dataquest got me working with Date and time in Python today and I learned the following:
...Thinking about the maximum and minimum appointment time values, and exploring the data to explain why these values are larger than you might expect.
...Find the visitor who spent the most amount of time at the White House.
...Finding who visited the White House the most each month.

==================================DAY 05===============================
Today have been working on a Project on Dataquest; Exploring Hackers News

=================================== DAY 06 ==============================
Saturday is always a super busy day but this challenge got me practising and revising some introduction to Numpy as I continue exploring the Hackers News Data.
Here are the things I learned today:

...How vectorization makes our code faster.
...About n-dimensional arrays, and NumPy's ndarrays.
...How to select specific items, rows, columns, 1D slices, and 2D slices from ndarrays.
...How to apply simple calculations to entire ndarrays.
...How to use vectorized methods to perform calculations across either axis of ndarrays.
