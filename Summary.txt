===================================== DAY 01=============================
I completed one of the mision have been doing on Dataquest.
In this mission, I learned how to:

...Remove unwanted characters to "clean" data stored as strings.
...Make data more uniform by replacing characters and modifying the case.
...Handle errors during data cleaning.
...Parse and clean complex strings.
...In the next mission, we're going to continue working with the MoMA data set as we learn the basics of analyzing data in Python.
